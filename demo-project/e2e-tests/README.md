# Open SaaS e2e Tests with Playwright

These are e2e tests that are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for the Open SaaS project. 

They not only serve as tests for development of the Open SaaS project, but also as reference examples for how you can implement tests for the app you build with Open SaaS as a template, if you choose to do so.

## Running the tests
### Locally
First, make sure you've [integrated Stripe into your app](https://docs.opensaas.sh/guides/stripe-integration/). This includes  [installing the Stripe CLI and logging into it](https://docs.opensaas.sh/guides/stripe-testing/) with your Stripe account.

Next, Install the test dependencies:
```shell
cd e2e-tests && npm install
```

Start your Wasp DB and leave it running:
```shell
cd ../app && wasp db start
```

Open another terminal and start the Wasp app with the environment variable set to skip email verification in development mode:
```shell
cd app && SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_IN_DEV=true wasp start
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When using the email auth method a verification link is sent when the user registers, or logged to the console if you're using the default Dummy provider. You must click this link to complete registration. Setting SKIP_EMAIL_VERIFICATION_IN_DEV to "true" skips this verification step, allowing you to automatically log in. This step must be skipped when running tests, otherwise the tests will hang and fail as the verification link is never clicked!

In another terminal, run the local e2e tests:
```shell
cd e2e-tests && npm run local:e2e:start
```

This will start the tests in Playwright's UI mode, which will allow you to see and run the tests in an interactive browser environment. You should also see the Stripe events being triggered in the terminal where the tests were started.

To exit the local e2e tests, go back to the terminal were you started your tests and press `ctrl + c`.

## CI/CD

Although the Open SaaS template does not come with an example workflow, you can find one at `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml` of the [remote repo](https://github.com/wasp-lang/open-saas).

You can copy and paste the `.github/` directory containing the `e2e-tests.yml` workflow into the root of your own repository to run the tests as part of your CI pipeline.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please make sure to update the `WASP_VERSION` environment variable in the `e2e-tests.yml` file to match the version of Wasp you are using in your project.

In order for these tests to run correctly on GitHub, you need to provide the environment variables mentioned in the `e2e-tests.yml` file within your GitHub repository's "Actions" secrets so that they can be accessed by the tests.

Upon pushing to the repository's main branch, or creating a PR against the main branch, the tests will run in the CI/CD pipeline.
